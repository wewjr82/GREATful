<h2>How It's Made:</h2>



<p>Tech used: HTML5, CSS3 (flexbox) & Formspree</p>

<p>I developed the GREATful website using HTML, CSS flexbox, and Formspree. Formspree is a service that allows you to create and manage forms on your website. It provides a simple way to collect user input and send it to a specified destination. It is a great tool for collecting user input on your website.

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>I had just started learning flexbox, so building this site was a great way for me to get my hands dirty and learn more about its capabilities. I also learned how to integrate Formspree to create a functional form, similar to how you would do with Mailchimp. Building this site was a great learning experience for me.</p>
